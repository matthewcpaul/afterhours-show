            <h2>A Poster Party Off the Clock</h2>
            <p class="editorial">Afterhours is an opportunity for the creatives in Central Texas to do something they are passionate about outside the constraints of the nine-to-five grind. It's part individual creative expression, part curated poster show, and part non-profit fundraiser.</p>
            <p class="editorial">Every year we’ll choose a theme, partner with a local or national non-profit, gather talent via a call for entries, and ask designers to create a handmade original print inspired by that year’s theme.</p>

            <h2>30 Artists, 30 Prints, 30 Bucks</h2>
            <p class="editorial">The goal of this show is simple. We want to galvanize the design community by helping individual designers feed their inner creative beast and simultaneously benefit the larger regional community. </br></br> To do this, we’ll have an open call for entries judged by four top-tier designers. They’ll pick 30 artists to create an original piece of poster art around this years theme: Food.</p>
            <p class="editorial">All the prints will be sold over the course of the show with a portion of the proceeds to the artists, and a portion going to this year’s non-profit, The Capital Area Food Bank of Texas.</p>

            <p>Alright, so how do you show your work at Afterhours? Well it’s pretty simple. To be considered for the show, send us three digital samples of previous work (URLs, JPGs, PDFs, etc.) </br></br> While we definitely look for experience in screen screen-printing, letterpress and other printing techniques, your samples do not need to be posters and/or theme-related —just work that shows your skills and style.</p>
            <p>One note, Afterhours has a Central Texas focus—only artists living in Austin and the surrounding area will be considered. </br></br> Please do not submit proposed/spec poster designs — only artists who are selected for the show will be asked to create new work. We’ll share specific guidelines for the show with all prospective artists who submit work for consideration.</p>
